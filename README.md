# Reddit Posts Op for CTO.ai Ops CLI

Quickly get posts from Reddit in your terminal window or Slack app. The default is World News, but I'll update it soon, so you can change it to any subreddit. The Reddit posts Op runs on the CTO.ai Ops CLI.

### Installation

First install the Ops Platform CLI from CTO.ai: https://cto.ai

```shell
npm i @cto.ai/ops
```

```shell
ops run @cawood/reddit
```
